                Coming out of my cage
                <br>   And I've been doing just fine
                <br>Gotta gotta be down
                <br> Because I want it all
                <br>It started out with a kiss
                <br>How did it end up like this?
                <br>It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
                <br>Now I'm falling asleep
                <br>And she's calling a cab
                <br>While he's having a smoke
                <br>And she's taking a drag
                <br>Now they're going to bed
                <br>And my stomach is sick
                <br>And it's all in my head
                <br>But she's touching his chest now
                <br> He takes off her dress now
                <br>Let me go
                <br>And I just can't look, it's killing me
                <br>And taking control
                <br>Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
                <br>Swimming through sick lullabies
                <br>Choking on your alibis
                <br>But it's just the price I pay
                <br>Destiny is calling me
                <br>Open up my eager eyes
                <br>'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
                <br>I'm coming out of my cage
                <br>And I've been doing just fine
                <br>Gotta gotta be down
                <br>Because I want it all

                <br>How did it end up like this?
                <br>(It was only a kiss), it was only a kiss
                <br>Now I'm falling asleep
